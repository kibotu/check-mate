## üîÑ Bidirectional Communication

Both platforms support:

### Web ‚Üí Native
- **Request-Response**: Web calls native and awaits response
- **Fire-and-Forget**: Web sends message without waiting
- Timeout handling (30 seconds default)
- Error handling with structured error codes

### Native ‚Üí Web
- **Fire-and-Forget Events**: Native sends events to web
- **Request-Response**: Native calls web and awaits response
- Demo event after 5 seconds on page load

## üìã Implementation Details

### Android
- **Language**: Kotlin
- **WebView**: Android WebView with JavascriptInterface
- **Async**: Kotlin Coroutines
- **Serialization**: Kotlinx Serialization
- **UI Framework**: AppCompatActivity

### iOS
- **Language**: Swift
- **WebView**: WKWebView with WKScriptMessageHandler
- **Async**: Swift Concurrency (async/await)
- **UI Framework**: SwiftUI + UIKit

### JavaScript Bridge
- **Version**: 1.0.0 (same on both platforms)
- **API**: Identical JavaScript API on both platforms
- **Pattern**: Promise-based with async/await support
- **Features**: 
  - Timeout support
  - AbortSignal support
  - Debug logging
  - Message queuing
  - Error handling

---

## üé® UI Consistency

Both HTML UIs feature:
- Modern gradient background (#667eea to #764ba2)
- Card-based layout with rounded corners
- Responsive button grids
- Color-coded status indicators
- Monospace console output
- Device info display cards
- Consistent spacing and typography

---

## üß™ Testing

Both apps include:
- Individual feature tests
- "Run All Tests" automation
- Console logging for all operations
- Error display with visual feedback
- Success/failure indicators

---

## üìù Notes

1. Both platforms use the same HTML/JS files with platform-specific bridge detection
2. The JavaScript bridge automatically detects iOS (webkit) vs Android (AndroidBridge)
3. All async operations support timeouts and cancellation
4. Debug mode can be enabled on both platforms for detailed logging
5. Both apps demonstrate the same demo event (native ‚Üí web) after 5 seconds

---

## ‚ú® Result

The iOS and Android sample apps now have **100% feature parity**, demonstrating identical capabilities in:
- Bridge action support
- UI demonstrations
- Bidirectional communication patterns
- Error handling
- Testing capabilities

This ensures developers can use either sample app as a reference and expect the same functionality across both platforms.
