/// Helper class for Keychain operations
///
/// **Why a separate helper class?**
/// - Encapsulates Keychain's complex Security framework APIs
/// - Shared by multiple bridge handlers (save/load/remove secure data)
/// - Makes testing easier by centralizing Keychain logic
/// - Provides a clean, simple API over Apple's C-style Security APIs
///
/// **Security Configuration:**
/// Uses `kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlocked` which means:
/// - Data is only accessible when device is unlocked
/// - Balances security with usability
/// - Prevents access to sensitive data if device is stolen and locked
///
/// **Design Decision:**
/// Stores data as generic password items (kSecClassGenericPassword) because:
/// - It's the most flexible Keychain item type
/// - Works for any key-value pair
/// - Doesn't require certificates or special configurations
